## Dynamics

Everything here is a MATLAB Livescript physics simulation. Most are self-explanatory in purpose if not in methodology. I hope in the future to develop visuals for these to help with comprehension, but for now you'll just have to trust that it all works. Each of the scripts is set up such that the first section determines the equations of motion symbolically, allowing all changes to the parameters to be made and simulated without rerunning the whole file.

The best file is definitely `WheelsWithinWheels.m`, that one took a while to get working but it is very satisfying to run.
